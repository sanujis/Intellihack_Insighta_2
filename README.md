# Instructions for Running the Program

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system)

Required libraries:
+ Pandas for data manipulation

+ NumPy for numerical operations

+ Scipy for statistical functions

+ TensorFlow for building the autoencoder

+ sklearn for clustering and other machine learning tasks

+ matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KuPtcQwsEIVZEvanAgGdFleg89EyZnF2/view?usp=drive_link

Download the Customer segmentation.py file from 


## Setup:

Open the Customer segmentation.py file in your Python IDE or text editor.

Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal/command prompt:

pip install pandas numpy scipy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn



## Running the Code:

To execute the segmentation, run the following command:

python Customer segmentation.py


Specify the correct path for your dataset. Ensure that the dataset_path in the script points to the correct location of your dataset file:

dataset_path = "/path/to/your/dataset/customer_behavior_analytcis.csv"


## Reproducing Results:

After running the script, the output will include the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index, along with the segmented results displayed in a visual format.
