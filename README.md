# Instructions for Running the Program

## Prerequisites:

Python 3.x

Required libraries:
+ Pandas for data manipulation

+ NumPy for numerical operations

+ Scipy for statistical functions

+ TensorFlow for building the autoencoder

+ sklearn for clustering and other machine learning tasks

+ matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KuPtcQwsEIVZEvanAgGdFleg89EyZnF2/view?usp=drive_link


## Setup:

Navigate to the project directory: cd [project directory]

Install the required libraries: pip install pandas numpy scipy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn



## Running the Code:

To execute the segmentation, run the following command:
python Customer segmentation.py

Make sure to provide the correct file path to the dataset in the code.


## Reproducing Results:

After running the script, the output will include the Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index, along with the segmented results displayed in a visual format.
